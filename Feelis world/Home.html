				I'm 56 doggy years old and have been living with my humans since this lock-in thingy.  I dont know why my humans keep fussing about it, life couldnt be better.  Before I met my new humans I was living at a bigger house called <a href="https://www.dogstrust.ie/" target="_blank">dogstrust</a>.  I didnt really enjoy it there.  One day I got an email that I would be leaving dogsrust to go to a new home.  At first I was a little apprensive about the move but my new humans we really nice to me when I first met them and they made the transition really easy for me.  I was a bit sad before I met them but now life couldn't be better.  I get to go on walks everyday, pose for <a href="Images.html">pictures</a>, learn new tricks and get rewards for doing them and get all the belly rubs I want.  In my down time, I like to help my human with his html as he is only learning it and I have been writing code for almost 30 dog years now.  He's not perfect yet but he is getting there, he is a good boy.  To find out more about me, I have an about me section on my site so be sure to check that out.
