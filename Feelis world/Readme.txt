Going beyond lectures examples: 
-The style of the nav bar and frames using an outset border to try and add depth to the website.  The frames also use box shadow to add depth to the images.  

-Putting the text in front of the image is also something I went out to looked up for myself.  

-Uses opacity, transition and rounded edges on the dogs trust logo on the last page to make more interactive and pleasant to loop at.
